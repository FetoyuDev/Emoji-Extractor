# Emoji Extractor
Emoji Extractor is a simple tool that I've made to extract and download custom emojis from any discord server, this tool can extract and download static and animated emojis. (For the guides in other languages, scroll down.)

# Disclaimer

### For based Ubuntu/Debian distros
```bash
sudo apt update -y && sudo apt install curl git -y
```

### For based Fedora/CentOS/Red Hat distros
- if system uses "yum"
```bash
sudo yum install curl git -y
```

- If system uses "DNF"
```bash
sudo dnf install curl git -y
```

### For based Arch Linux distros
```bash
sudo pacman install -Sy curl git --noconfirm
```

### For based openSUSE distros
```bash
sudo zypper install curl git -y
```
